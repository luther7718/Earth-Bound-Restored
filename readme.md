This patch changes the title screen of pancakes' MOTHER Restored patch from the Japanese MOTHER design back to the Earth Bound title screen from the US prototype.

This patch should be applied to a rom already patched with MOTHER Restored. 
This patch is compatible with both of the patches included in MOTHER Restored Difficulty Tweaks, as long as you apply this one first.
