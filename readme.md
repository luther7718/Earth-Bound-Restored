This is a small addendum to pancakes' MOTHER Restored patch to revert the 
Mother title screen and intro back to the US prototype rom's Earth Bound 
title screen.

If you'd like one of the many title screens available for the 25th Anniversary 
patches instead then let me know and I can take a crack at it.

You should apply this to a rom already patched with MOTHER Restored, matching 
either of these checksums: 
MOTHER Restored (proto header): 320e027a6a138d73729161a54e182a2ddede75f6
